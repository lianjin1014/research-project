Knowing the surgical skills of surgeons is critical for their training, thus, medical
schools are increasingly seeking ways of measurement to assess it. This is particularly
important in minimally invasive surgery, because these surgeries are more demanding
for surgeons. Eye tracking is a promising approach in recent years to provide objective
indicators of visual perception. In this work, we report results of a cadaver study on
shoulder visual perception arthroscopy. We propose a model that divides surgeons into
three types by using only professional eye movements data. The Model reaches the classification accuracy of 87.33% by using only a few selected features. Features are selected
by analysis of variance method. After classification task, we want to show how to recognize the state of confusion of young surgeons, because knowing the state of confusion
is crucial for the training of young surgeons. We preprocess the imbalanced dataset by
a combination of under-sampling and over-sampling, and then perform person-specific
splitting the samples into the training set and a test set. By looking at the eye and head
movements data, we finally reached an accuracy of 84.8% by feeding them into neural
network. Through our model, the surgeonâ€™s perception-cognitive process during arthroscopic surgery can be further optimized.
